LuaLogging

LuaLogging provides a simple API to use logging features in Lua.
Its design was based on log4j. LuaLogging currently supports,
through the use of appenders, console, file, email, socket and sql outputs.

Current version is 1.1.4. It was developed for Lua 5.1.

LuaLogging is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1. It is part of the Kepler Project. 

To install LuaLogging, copy the "logging" directory to your package.path

Please see docs at http://www.keplerproject.org/lualogging for more details

Guide lines for improved logging performance
--------------------------------------------

The changes that I have made allow more complex log message formatting to be done only when 
that log level is enabled.  This will decrease the impact of logging statement when their level 
is disabled.

* Use string.format() style formating:

logger:info("Some message prefix: val1='%s', val2=%d", "some string value", 1234)

* For more complex log message formating:

local function log_callback(val1, val2)
	-- Do some complex pre-processing of parameters, maybe dump a table to a string.
	-- Note: all returned values are passed to string.format()
	return "Some message prefix: val1='%s', val2=%d", val1, val2
end
-- function 'log_callback' will only be called if the current log leve is "DEBUG"
logger:debug(log_callback, "some string value", 1234)
